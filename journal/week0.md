# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

- Set a Billing alarm.

I logged in to my AWS account and created a Billing alarm following the instructions in the Cloud-Practitioner certification course in the Exampro YouTube channel.

I configured it to send a notification message through the SNS service whenever the estimated cost goes above $15. The SNS would in-turn sens me an email.

Below is the screenshot of the same:

- Generating AWS Credentials.

I created a new IAM credentials for the bootcamp purpose. I created a new account alias as well. Now I dont have to remember the account-id to login to the console. I also added MFA to the new account.
